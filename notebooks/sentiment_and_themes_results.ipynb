       "52              The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.   \n",

Can‚Äôt log in, can‚Äôt transfer money, can‚Äôt even check my balance without it bugging out. To the developer: Are you actually trying to make this work, or is this some kind of social experiment to test our patience? Did you build this in your sleep? Because it definitely looks like it. If this is your idea of a functional app, maybe consider a different career pathüôè   \n",

Did y'all consider that I might, perhaps, be an actual developer? Why am I expected to toggle the option on and off just to bank (restarting my phone when I do)? Why is the message labled as somthing that will \"smoothen\" the experience? This is like the most \"security consultant\" thing to implement in an app. Please invest in actual security, not this mess.   \n",

       "565    I will give only one star, because it faced with multiple of problems. 1. The app is not as fast as the other banks App, for e.g like CBE 2. The App asks repeatedly to switch off developer options, even if it is switched off. 3. Bank of Abyssinia's services are interesting, but they ignored the issues on the App service. 4. Most customers gave a complain on the App, but no one accept their complain to fix the issue. 5. Lastly, I will not recommend the App unless the issue has been solved ASAP!!   \n",

Even though this ine is hetter it still s*cks! It will ask me to turn off developer options other wise it won't work! I use CBE, Awash birr, tekebirr, Dashen bank and others but non of them asked me this, why only BoA? Please improve your mobile banking, be competitive!   \n",

       "698           BOA is unreasonably holding and delaying transactions for more than a day, even transactions within the same bank itself. This is a huge gap that I observed in BOA mobile banking. I didn't experience this kind of challenge while having transactions in other banks' mobile banking platforms. After waiting so long, I called your customer support team and the response they gave me was \"it was the system that holds the transaction & will be released on working days\". This is not totally fair.   \n",

It's been going backwards since last year or so. The app is a disaster to use in every possible way. Not stable to log in and very slow to perform transactions, couldn't take a screenshot (or can't even find the pictures even using its save screenshot option). Most of the time, it fails to perform transactions and so on. Simply, it's the worst!   \n",

They always respond to customers that they are updating their system all year long, I think that's what they train their customer service operators to do.   \n",

       "1128                       I had a disappointing experience with Dashen Bank's Super Up service. The app is very slow and takes forever to load during transactions, which is incredibly frustrating. Additionally, it doesn't generate receipts for any transactions, making it difficult to keep track of my expenses. I also reached out to customer support, but the response time was longer than expected. Overall, I was hoping for a better experience, but I find the service lacking and in need of improvement.   \n",
